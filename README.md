hikar.org repo - IMPORTANT NOTICE
=================================

This repo now contains *ONLY* the main index page for hikar.org, containing
information about the Hikar project, plus CSS.

The Hikar AR app itself has now been split into its own repo, for ease
of installation as a standalone entity. Please see (and **NOTE THE CHANGED URL**):

https://github.com/nickw1/hikar.js

**Please note** that this is a **rebased**, **cleaned up** new repository, replacing the former `hikar-webapp` repo which contained various experiments and tests and had thus become rather messy.
