<h2>What is Hikar?</h2>
<p>
Hikar 
(see <a href='https://gitlab.com/nickw1/hikar'>
gitlab repository</a>) is an augmented reality app for Android (4.2+) which 
overlays OpenStreetMap roads and footpaths
on the device's camera feed. Its aim is to help navigation for walkers/hikers (hence the name) and other outdoor users. For example,
imagine you are entering a large field and it's not clear where the exit is.
Hikar will overlay the course of the footpath on your phone's camera feed 
allowing you to navigate across the field. Or, you're at a junction of paths
and it's not clear which is the correct way. Again, Hikar will indicate which
path is correct by overlaying the course of the path on the camera
feed. Or, you're having to make your way across a pathless moor. Again,
Hikar will show you the way.</p>
<p>Hikar also uses <em>virtual signposts</em> showing the direction and
distance to nearby points of interest (see the screenshots below).</p>
<h3>Colour scheme</h3>
<p>The colour scheme used for the roads and paths is:</p>
<ul>
<li>green = a path (highway=footway in OSM);</li>
<li>brown = bridleway or anything with designation=public_bridleway</li>
<li>red = byway or restricted byway (in England and Wales only)</li>
<li>orange = track</li>
<li>light blue = cycleway</li>
<li>white = road, or anything else</li>
</ul>

<h2>Using Hikar</h2>
<p>The current version, 0.2, is available on
<a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=freemap.hikar'>
Google Play</a>.
Data will then be downloaded from the server (or from the device
storage; once downloaded, data is cached on the device). If the download
fails (e.g. no network connection), it will try again shortly.
You can also pre-download data for a certain area before you go out (to avoid
relying on poor network connectivity in the countryside); to
do this select the "Download data at a given location" menu option and enter
the latitude and longitude of where you are going. An area a little over 5kmx5km
containing
this latitude and longitude will be downloaded.</p>

<p>Hikar will automatically work out the horizontal field of view of your 
camera on Android 5.0+ devices. However if this is inaccurate, or you wish to
zoom in to view the signposts, you may
change it by pinching the screen in and out. The 
new field of view will appear on the display.</p>

These were taken early September 2013
with a very early version; further work has been done 
since so it may not look exactly like this.</p>




<h2>Issues</h2>

<p>Do please note that Hikar is a research project, so I have focused on
developing the AR features rather than making a really nice UI. Also do
please note these issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uses quite a bit of battery power - perhaps inevitable for this kind of app.
Therefore, only use it when you need to and ensure your battery is fully
charged before setting out.</li>
<li>GPS inaccuracy leading to the path from OpenStreetMap being slightly 
offset from its true position</li>
<li>Difficulty in aligning OSM data with the camera feed when climbing hills due to the difficulty of holding the device steady</li>
<li>Possible out-of-memory issues when parsing the GeoJSON on low memory devices or when data is dense. In particular it is <strong>not intended for use in large urban areas</strong> (e.g. large cities).</li>
</ul>


<h2>Coverage</h2>

<p>Version 0.2 covers <strong>the whole of Europe, plus Turkey</strong>.</p>

<h2>Upcoming version 0.3</h2>

<p>Upcoming version 0.3 will be released by mid-September 2019 and will
contain these new features:
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Route to a nearby POI.</strong> Hikar will be able to 
	calculate a route to a nearby point of interest; this will be overlaid on
	the OpenStreetMap data as a thicker yellow line... a "yellow brick road"
	if you like!</li>
	<li><strong>Virtual noticeboards.</strong> The existing signpost feature
	will be extended to show virtual noticeboards, informing users of places
	of interest (such as viewpoints or historical sites) or warning users of
	hazards or issues (such as steep paths, animals or blocked paths). 
	These noticeboards will be <strong>crowdsourced from this website</strong>
	and you can start adding them <strong>now</strong>... click the "create
	noticeboards" link above.</li>
	<li>Facility to pre-download data at a given location will have a map-based
	interface.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<h2>Detail on how it works (briefly)</h2>

<p>Hikar uses the Android location and sensor APIs to obtain the location and orientation of the device, then loads OSM data (as GeoJSON, produced from a PostGIS database) and height data (the Mapzen Terrarium elevation data set, now
available via Amazon S3).
The data is then cached on the device to avoid network access next time you're in that area. The height data is used to position the OSM data in 3D, e.g. overlay a footpath on the slope of a hill so that it appears correctly. The sensor API is used to obtain an orientation matrix which is then used with OpenGL to display the OSM data overlaid on the device's camera feed.</p>

<h2 id="privacy">Privacy policy</h2>
<p>Hikar uses the camera to show the real world on the phone screen. It does
NOT use the camera for any privacy-violating actions such as taking unwanted
pictures of yourself or your surroundings. No camera images are stored on the
device or uploaded to a remote server.</p>
<p>Hikar also tracks the device's location as this is necessary for the correct
footpaths to be overlaid on your current camera feed. Again, 
personally-identifiable location data is not sent to the server or stored
anywhere else. The current latitude and longitude is sent to the Freemap 
server for the purposes of finding the correct OpenStreetMap data for your 
current location only.</p>
